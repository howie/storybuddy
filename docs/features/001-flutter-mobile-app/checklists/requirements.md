# Requirements Quality Checklist: Flutter Mobile App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness, clarity, and coverage before implementation.
**Created**: 2026-01-05
**Feature**: [Flutter Mobile App Spec](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness & Gaps

- [ ] CHK001 Are error handling requirements defined for network failures during voice sample upload? [Gap, US1]
- [ ] CHK002 Is the specific retry or fallback behavior defined for "voice model creation failed" status? [Gap, FR-004]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements specified for handling interrupted story downloads (resume vs restart)? [Gap, US4]
- [ ] CHK004 Are specific reading level metrics or examples provided for "simple and easy to understand" AI answers? [Completeness, US3]
- [ ] CHK005 Is the behavior defined for when a user logs out while sync operations are pending? [Gap, Sync]

## Clarity & Ambiguity

- [ ] CHK006 Is "background noise too loud" quantified with a specific decibel threshold or SNR metric? [Clarity, Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK007 Is the "30 seconds to 1 minute" recording limit a hard enforcement (auto-stop) or UI guidance? [Clarity, US1]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the definition of "story scope" for Q&A clearly defined (e.g., metadata-based vs full-text context)? [Clarity, US3]
- [ ] CHK009 Is the session timeout duration for Q&A sessions explicitly specified? [Clarity, QASession Entity]
- [ ] CHK010 Is the "50MB app size" limit (SC-005) inclusive of initial cached assets or just the install binary? [Clarity, SC-005]

## Consistency

- [ ] CHK011 Do "offline mode" requirements align with AI dependencies (e.g., is Q&A disabled or cached offline)? [Consistency, Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK012 Is the "delete local data" (PS-004) requirement consistent with sync logic (does it trigger remote deletion)? [Consistency, PS-004]
- [ ] CHK013 Does the "background playback" requirement (FR-008) conflict with any potential battery saving constraints? [Consistency]

## Scenario Coverage (Edge Cases)

- [ ] CHK014 Are requirements defined for when microphone permission is revoked *during* an active recording session? [Coverage, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK015 Is the behavior specified for incoming calls *during recording* (spec only mentions playback)? [Coverage, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK016 Are requirements defined for conflict resolution when data is modified on multiple devices simultaneously? [Coverage, Sync]
- [ ] CHK017 Is the behavior defined when the app is terminated by the OS during a long background upload? [Coverage, Resilience]
- [ ] CHK018 Are empty states defined for the "Pending Questions" list and "Story List"? [Coverage, UX]

## Non-Functional Requirements (Privacy, Security)

- [ ] CHK019 Are key management requirements defined for the local AES-256 encryption (where is the key stored)? [Completeness, PS-001]
- [ ] CHK020 Are battery consumption limits defined for long audio playback sessions? [Gap, Performance]
- [ ] CHK021 Is the data retention policy for voice recordings on the *server* defined/communicated to the user? [Gap, Privacy]
- [ ] CHK022 Are accessibility requirements (VoiceOver/TalkBack) defined for the custom waveform and player controls? [Gap, A11y]
